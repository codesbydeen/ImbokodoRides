# Imbokodo Rides

Women themed e-hailing ride application.

## Description

I have completed my final year project which was a native mobile application. ðŸŽ‰

This project holds a special place in my heart as it aimed to address a crucial need for sage and reliable transportation options for female students. Recognising the challenges many face when commuting, my team and I worked diligently to create a user-friendly application that prioritises security, convenience and peace of mind.

This project not only allowed me to apply my technical skills in React Native development but also instilled a sense of responsibility and empathy in me. It was truly rewarding to create a solution that addresses real-world challenges faced by female students, empowering them to navigate their journeys confidently.

I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to my amazing team members, supportive mentors, and the faculty who guided us throughout this project.

I am immensely proud of the outcome and excited to leverage the knowledge gained from this project.

Hereâ€™s to the successful completion of a memorable IT project!ðŸŽ‰ðŸŒŸ
